There are ongoing software developments based on the blockchain cryptography technology that might match these needs. The blockchain is an algorithm that allows for time-proofed, decentralized transference of data. It was part of the invention of the internet cyptocurreny bitcoin.  Bitcoin has, since its inception, spawned a number of promising new software scripts. Just to give the reader an idea of the type of possible services, in the following a few examples are briefly introduced:
•	To take the financial burden of scientific discovery and product development away from researcher, projects could in future be funded through crowdfunding campaigns based on decentralized blockchain technology: 
“Swarm is a crowdfunding platform powered by Bitcoin 2.0 technology. It allows the users of a product to also be its investors. Everyone benefits as the platform grows.“  
•	To make contracts between industry partners and the Bio-Strike community project, blockchain based platform Ethereum could be used. It is especially interesting as it promises to allow for the foundation of so called “decentral autonomous organization”  able to manage data as well as digital currencies through voting by its members.
“Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company governance, contracts and agreements of most kind, intellectual property, and even smart property thanks to hardware integration. Ethereum borrows the concept of decentralized consensus that makes bitcoin so resilient, yet makes it trivial to build on its foundation.”  
•	To process and store scientific data safely in the cloud, the Maidsafe software as an encrypted, decentral storage and computation instance could be used:
 “MaidSafe is a fully decentralized platform on which application developers can build decentralized applications. The network is made up by individual users who contribute storage, computing power and bandwidth to form a world-wide autonomous system.” 
•	DNA.bits promises the handling of sensitive data like a patients genome through encryption. The concept will make the genetic information fully accessible to the researchers who need it, while using strong private keys to maintain digital DNA-wallet privacy and individual anonymity. 
Despite the promises that software solutions based on cryptography hold, it should be kept in mind that these are still under development. Setting up a project like Biostrike on such a service would thus be highly experimental. Nevertheless, it might, after some time of development and evaluation constitute, the necessary infrastructure for a global, trustworthy and decentralized scientific research collaboration that is democratically controlled by a community of citizens and scientists.
