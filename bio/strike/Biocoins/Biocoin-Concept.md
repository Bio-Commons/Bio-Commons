Biocoins
==========

Success of the Biostrike project is directly dependent on crowd participation or a function of traction. To provide broad scaling incentivization and a means to commensurately regulate reward quantums provided for by investors, we conceived the idea of a digital currency. Biocoin is envisioned to be an objective measure of a current valuation of antibiotic potential of the soil samples biostrikers are harvesting. The concept emulates Solarcoin, which pegs a digital currency against the modern valuation of generated solar energy. Biocoin is also a kind of gamification point system to incentivize participation in Biostrike.

There are differences between Biocoin and Solarcoin. An individual may readily accept solar energy generated as immediately usable, but he would be unable to accept the tangible final deliverable of the Biostrike project, which are gene sequences from harvested soil samples, as something of immediate value. While Solarcoin pegs against solar energy which translates directly into a usable form that can see ready demand, Biocoin would have to involve an extra step. Secondly, while solar energy can be readily consolidated into the same form, disparate soil samples cannot be combined as such. This lends reason to establish Biocoin as a form of digital point system that serve also as identifiers that individually tracks the progress of harvested soil samples. This also allows the tracking of the transaction of Biocoin on a [distributed consensus ledger](https://medium.com/future-of-currency/c65e368d4b3) much akin to Bitcoin. In this way, while Biocoin is not strictly a cryptocurrency - it misses the mechanistic characteristic of hash string computation - the core aspects of what makes Bitcoin revolutionary in terms of a distributed ledger to track everything that transacts in the currency is preserved.   

Harnessing the Ripple Protocol
==========

The running value of Biocoin rests on a collective's input of existing currencies into the project. It is possible to allow for inter-currency normalization through the [Ripple protocol] (https://ripple.com/), which emulates the naure of crytocurrency without forcing people to dal with crytocurrency. Individual investors, corporations and governments are able to contribute to the central pool of Biocoin fund as a proxy measure of current demand for new antibiotics, using any currency of their preference, whether is it USD or SGD or JPY. Ripple's role in Biocoins would be normalization of currency into a value that translates into a currency preference that different parties would be better able to better appreciate. 

If so, why the need for a digital currency in the first place?

The mechanism comes full circle as we explain that Biocoin is not a cryptocurrency yet still a digital currency that allows for a current identifier of genetic sequencing, which may take time to fully unravel. Unlike Bitcoin, there is no mining to complete hash sequences but "mining" to unravel unknown genetic sequences. Rather than employ precious computing power to mine something of arbitrary value, the "mining" here actually accomplishes something that creates new and valuable knowledge. By this regard, an API has to be created to facilitate the automation of gene sequencing through the potential brute force of crowdsourced computing power.

# How it works

Before the genetic sequences are fully unraveled, a Biocoin identifier with a nominal value is tagged to these yet-to-be-unraveled genetic sequences. Unraveling a large sequence of genetic information is basically about identifying the key sequences in a enormous chain that contributes directly to specific antibiotic prowess. It is quite like finding a needle in a haystack. Biocoin is also awarded to people who contribute computing power to the Biostrike program, which like SETILive allows a voluntary collective to contribute towards a crowdsourcing venture of finding extraterrestrial intelligence. Again a nominal value is attached to these efforts. When you do discover something of clear antibiotic potential, your nominal Biocoin is boosted to an order commensurate to the investor pool set aside for sequences that will help humanity.

Investors to the Bitcoin project are able to delineate how much real world money goes towards definitive antibiotic discovery and how much goes towards the necessary but laborious task of harvesting and "mining" of genetic sequences in the Biostrike repository.

It is by default suggested that 20% of Biostrike funding goes towards harvesting and mechanical turk tasks, while 80% premium awarded to those high impact sequences.

# Backing and Betting

By coming up with unique digital identifiers for unique soil sample projects, it is also possible to bet on these identifiers for a profit motive. A commensurate return on investment will be rewarded when gene sequenced soil samples have been laboratory-tested to possess strong antibiotic prowess. As to how to get information on which soil samples are potentially viable, a [mobile application](https://github.com/DennisAng/BioStrike/tree/master/Mobile%20Interface) will serve the "mechanical turk" part of Biostrike, which is to collectively and manually identify soil samples with good zones of inhibition.
