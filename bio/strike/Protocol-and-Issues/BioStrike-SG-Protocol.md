##  Stage 01 : Acquisition of bacteria
### a.	Soil sample collection

#### Protocol
> *	In a clean plastic bag or jar collect a soil sample
*	(some advice on best sites - places where bacteria compete next to a decaying tree trunk etc?)
*	take picture of the site
*	include GPS location
*	describe weather conditions
*	include any comments you think are relevant for this

#### Interface
> *	Upload a photo of sample site
*	Tag GPS
*	Tag weather conditions
*	Keywords?

#### Gamification
> *	Points or badges for number of soil samples?
*	Foursquare style of “owning a location” - owner of microbes in certain location (the king of…)

#### Issues
> *	People may want to collect more samples at once
    *  	Each sample is recorded as an individual documentation

### b.	Dilution process: preparation of the sample

#### Protocol
> *	Prepare sterilized test tubes containing 9ml  water each
*   Count and label them (eg. 6 test tubes, T1 to T6)
*	Place 1g of soil sample into the first test tube (T1)
*	Swirl test tube to mix solution well
*	Take 1ml out of the test tube and place diluted sample into the next one and swirl to mix solution well
    *  	(1ml  from T1 to T2, 1ml from T2, to T3 and so on)
*	Repeat above step until all test tubes contain a sample

#### Interface
> *	Containing protocol and short video or examples
*	Record total number of test tubes used
*	Other comments

#### Gamification
> *	Points or badges for clean samples?
*	Points or badges for doing multiple dilutions?


#### Issues
> *	People don’t do it right, how to scare/motivate them to dilute?
*	Measuring of dilution rate, what is the formula?
    *	Augmented reality mobile app comparing fluid levels in test tube (real time)

### c.	Agar plates inoculation

#### Protocol
> *	Prepare sterile petri dish with agar medium
*	Describe the agar medium
*	Homemade or bought from someone or lab
*	Describe test tube sample (maybe the label)
*	Dip sterilized inoculation loop into test tube containing diluted sample
*	Streak tip of the inoculation loop with sample onto the agar surface

#### Interface
> *	Containing protocol, short video and examples
*	Record description of agar medium
*	Record test tube sample
*	Other comments

#### Gamification
> *	Points every plate
    *	Perhaps points can help them to 1. bid for one that gets selected for sequencing; 2. for them to unlock projects 3. for them to ‘purchase’ things to beautify their virtual labs? 
    *	Hence, it is obvious if a person is an expert if he/she has an elaborate virtual laboratory on the app

#### Issues
> *	People don’t do it right, how to scare/motivate them?
d.	Incubating and Logging Soil Sample plate

### d.  Incubating and Logging Soil Sample plate

#### Protocol
> *	Decide whether to use an incubator or not
*	Automated or manual daily logging of temperature with picture and notes
*	Decide when to move on to Stage 2

#### Interface
> *	Record use of incubator or not
*	Record log with picture and notes
*	Option to move on to Stage 2

#### Gamification
> *	Points every plate or log

#### Issues
> *	None

## Stage 02: Identification and testing of antibiotics
### e.	Identification of actinomycetes

#### Protocol
> *	How to recognise the right ones?
*	Tap on expertise and crowdsource for possible candidates

#### Interface
> *	Picture tagging
*	Comments supporting expert supervision
    *	professional or experience users
*	Scale of 1-5 vote or bet system next to image
*	Sharing of image on social media for intelligence

#### Gamification
> *	Points for each culture on the plate

#### Issues
> *	Uncertainty about the right strain of bacteria

### f.	Testing Actinomycetes on E.coli plate

#### Protocol
> *	Prepare e.coli plate
*	Describe the medium
    *	Homemade or bought from someone or lab
*	Describe culture sample (maybe the label of dish and culture colony)
*	Collect some culture by scraping with sterilized inoculation loop 
*	Dab tip of the inoculation loop with culture onto the center of E. coli plate.

#### Interface
> *	Containing protocol, short video and examples
*	Record description of medium
*	Record culture sample (dish and culture colony labels)
*	Other comments

#### Gamification
> *	Points every plate
    *	Issue of repetitive and boring “gamification” process

#### Issues
> *	Uncertainty on precision of protocol (never managed to get zone of inhibition)

#### g.	Incubating and Logging E.coli plate

#### Protocol
> *	Decide whether to use an incubator or not
*	Automated or manual daily logging of temperature with picture and notes
*	Decide when to move on to Stage 3
*	Monitor for zone of inhibition and decide optimum size for public scrutiny

#### Interface
> *	Record use of incubator or not
*	Record log with picture and notes
*	Allow rating of zone of inhibition once open for public scrutiny
*	Option to move on to Stage 3

#### Gamification
> *	Points every plate or log
*	Points for size of zone of inhibition?
*	Collection of various zone of inhibitions?
*	Collection of odd plates (failures)

#### Issues
> *	None

## Stage 03: Identifying potential candidates for DNA sequencing

#### Protocol
> *	Identifying [antibiotic sensitivity][1] based on the zone of inhibition
*	Describe and quantify the zone of inhibition

#### Interface
> *	Experts vote or pledge money/bitcoin for the sequencing 
*	Attribution (funny names for the strain identified in this stage?) , creating a group of “funders” for a given sample
*	Sharing pictures on social media as a publication

#### Gamification
> *	Points for monetary contribution
*	Points for sharing on social media

#### Issues
> *	None
