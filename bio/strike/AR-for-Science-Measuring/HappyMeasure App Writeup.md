Purpose: To find a suitable app that can allow standardised photo taking to be integrated into The Biostrike Project's application

Shortlisted: Happy Measure - measure and easily create 3D models of everything through Augmented Reality and 3D models. Doing away with rulers.

Instructions:

1. Print out A4/US Letter sized HappyMeasure grid. This grid is made available here:
A4: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f23rnnfxm6rftgm/Ni2a5dnbY4/DIN_A4/marker_160mm_A4.pdf
US Letter: https://www.google.com/url?q=http://tinyurl.com/HappyMeasure-US-Letter&sa=D&usg=AFQjCNFRcO9AdlurrPsBqxoVYzyWAhFnQw

2. Download Happy Measure App (Only for Android)

3. Place object you want to measure beside grid. Allow camera to capture grid. If the 3D box that appears does not fit the grid exactly, calibrate the camera by choosing Settings-->Calibrate.

4. Place grid on top/below object. I used a petri dish in my attempt and placed it beside the grid. Capture a few images at different sides.

5. Head back to the menu on the left, and choose Settings-->'Interactions'. Here you get to choose how you want to fit your object into the 3D model- Face based or Corner Based. For a rounded petridish, Face-based is a better option.

6. After capturing a few images, you will have the option to scale the 3D image to fit your object.

7. After scaling, you will be allowed to take a screenshot to save it. The next time you open the screenshot via 'Library', you will be able to visualise the size of your item even without the object present.

PROS & CONS using Happy Measure for an open science project

# PROS
- Ability to measure objects accurately
- Users are able to share their 3D models instantly on the app
- Useful more for standardising set up process eg. Size of incubation tank; size of test tubes, etc.

CONS
-------
- Not very useful in standardising photo taking eg. length between camera and petridish; angle of photo; clear view of inhibition sites 
- Camera function not clear enough to take a petridish photo and show inhibition sites (which may not be obious)

Verdict:
Not suitable.
If only..
Happy Measure develops an exact one, but for viewing small images instead of large scale furnitures.
Or an app that measures length between camera and item and displays an augmented ruler and allowing that image to be captured.
