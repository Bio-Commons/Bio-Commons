# Market failure: antibiotic resistance
A prominent and dangerous outcome of such a development in the medical sector is the decline of usable antibiotics in the market. A global citizen science community investigates the potential technological innovations to allow for decentralized and commons based drug discovery on the example of antibiotics. The project is called Biostrike and was started as a science-art based educational project.www.bio-commons.org/bio/strike. It was chosen to be developed further into a lighthouse project for the Bio-Commons and to address the technical, social and legal questions around the Bio-Commons. Citizens believed that the main reasons for the lack of development of new antibiotics lies in the existing organizational structures predominating in public and private life science and research. One reason is a lack of public research efforts to tackle big societal challenges – despite a general availability of skilled personnel and infrastructure. The existing publication model is based on competition of scientists to publish first in a journal of high renown, which hinders the free exchange of knowledge due to paywalls and competition. This attitude prevents a wider collaboration and open sharing of results and thus makes a global effort to develop new antibiotics extremely difficult. 
Another, even more problematic reason is a classical market failure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure  in the pharmaceutical branch. Apart from the costs associated with regulation and cautious clinical testing of new pharmaceuticals market mechanisms contribute significantly to the increase in costs of drug research and development. The effect was described as ‘Eroom’s Law’, which refers to the exact opposite phenomenom described in Moore’s Law of the computer chip industry. Despite a steady exponential increase of available scientific information in the form of peer reviewed publications Citation Counts by Year of Publication; MEDLINE; U.S. National Library of Medicine; November 2013;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline_cit_counts_yr_pub.html and digital database sizes Growth of GenBank and WGS;National Center for Biotechnology Information,U.S. National Library of Medicine; Jun 2014;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics, the number of new drugs which were introduced to the market per billion dollar spent fell exponentially.
