The presented Biostrike scenarios can be considered an example for what type of data is created in life sciences. In scenario I, collected data in forms of publications, texts, machine readouts and pictures would be uploaded on a database and protected under the Bio-Commons license. Scenario II would yield a lot of DNA-sequences of yet undiscovered organisms. Depending on the sophistication of the sequencing technology, its market price and global availability, theoretically, an enormous number of organisms could be digitally analyzed and uploaded. Looking ahead, a “phase shift” from analog to digital biological information will happen. Vast numbers of biological systems will be digitalized by high throughput sequencing and parameterization of biological samples. To date, many ecospheres like coral reefs are recognized as a world heritage and thus belong to the natural commons. In future, these could become digitalized, quantified and eventually monetized.  ,  Under a Bio-Commons license, the digital redescription of these ecospheres could be kept in the commons and also managed by a large community, preventing overuse and misuse alike. Equally, the results yielded by the use of bioinformatic tools applied on the datasets need to be covered.
