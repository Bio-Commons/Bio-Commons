In future, there will be software solutions that allow for global and decentralized use of Bio-languages for community driven In-Silico design of novel biological systems. Ultimately, the digital redescription of the natural world will be mixed with human inventions and creations that will become increasingly indistinguishable and interdependent. The Bio-Commons license should therefore be able to cover natural, rational and creative In-Silico bio-designs generated by the community of researchers as a whole. The development of a new Bio-language opens the possibility for responsible research and innovation already at the stage of the design of a new living system. To address the social and ethical implications of Bio-design is not only the responsibility of the scientists, but requires involvement of a wide variety of stakeholders. As the development of bio-languages is in a very early phase, there is plenty of room for involvement of new stakeholders to influence the way in which these language will develop. A Bio-language is exactly the point, where human culture, the digital and the analog aspect of biological systems intersect. A new bio-language thus could allow a new type of ‘cultural coding’, hardwiring ideas such as ethical values by design, but also allowing for better feedback of biological discovery into the societal context. Besides, a Bio-language could be directly regulated by societies with legal instruments. A regulatory approach addressing the use of Bio-languages would allow societies to precisely shape their biological realities. The risk in regulating such a language is that imposed restrictions could result in an incomplete and dysfunctional description of the factual reality of nature. Bio-languages remain inherently anthropocentric and thus the danger of overlooking crucial e.g. ecological relations is present. However, it is to date the most progressive and promising approach to the design of life.
