The ‘classical’ examples of natural commons often end in tragedy: due to a lack of management, individuals act egoistically and overuse the resource, e.g. fish in the ocean, until it is finally depleted. The result is contrary to the interest of the community and also to the disadvantage of the individual. However, this argument does not apply on digital goods that are copyable. The only physical limit for digital goods is the available computation power and the energy needed for computation. As long as these factors are available in abundance, a ‘classical’ tragedy of the digital commons is highly unlikely, and the digital goods are practically inexhaustible. The code duality of living systems allows for a digital redescription of genetic code. This digital information can be copied and shared in the internet at almost no cost. When translated back into the analog counterpart, meaning the phenotype of a cell, e.g. by synthesizing the DNA and transforming a cell, the digital information that comes for free can be converted into highly valuable substances. The value of the substance can be monetary but does not need to be. In case of antibiotics, it would be a life prolonging therapy at almost no cost.
