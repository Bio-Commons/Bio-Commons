How to overcome this breakdown of innovation and in the same time fix the urgent antibiotics problem? The innovation process has to become more efficient to leverage the development costs. New technology platforms could be used to align research procedures and enhance synergy effects and make the use of knowledge and technology as convenient as possible.  Citizens believed, due to the shortcomings of the concepts of patents to foster life science innovations, actual legal innovation might become necessary. Alternative IP regimes such as open-access and open-source could in future help to leverage the costs for research and development in the life sciences, to mobilize unused knowledge, spark new inventions, be more adaptable to actual innovation speed and thus overcome the market failure situation. The bios organization states:
“Extraordinary efficiencies occur when the tools of innovation are shared, are dynamically enhanced, have increased levels of confidence (legal and otherwise) associated with their use, and are low or no-cost.” (Richard Jefferson)  
A Bio-Commons license which puts discovery and inventions in the life science under a common regulation, can serve to decentralized biological innovation, while at the same time allow for bigger cooperative projects. In consequence, the Bio-Commons license could even replace the need for patent thickets. Therefore, global and decentralized collaboration of scientists and citizens should be encouraged to speed up the development of new antibiotics. Such a new, decentralized way to handle the vast amounts of knowledge created in the life-science, raise questions on how to deal with intellectual property in general. 
“Could the development of new antibiotics be encouraged by the government? By simplifying how they are licensed and providing financial incentives, more drugs could be discovered.” (Liz Bonnin)
