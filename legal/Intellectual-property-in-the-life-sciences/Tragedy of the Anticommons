Even though the patent system was meant to provide investment-incentives for commercial developments serving the need of society, antibiotics is one of the areas in which this has failed. The situation turns out to be a classical market failure.   However, market failure is not the only explanation of the antibiotics-crisis. It is equally a problem of the overuse of a common, termed “Tragedy of the commons”. This means that non-managed common goods, such as natural resources, can be exploited by everyone. For example, all fishers overfish the oceans and thus destroy the foundation of their own livelihood. Widely available and cheap antibiotics can be considered as a common good, too. And the overuse of antibiotics creates resistant bacteria which can affect everyone. A ‘Market Failure’ in combination with the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’ thus becomes the ‘Tragedy of the Anticommons’.  The Anticommons problem arises when ambiguous and conflicting intellectual property claims offer worst of both worlds by deterring sharing and weakening investment incentives.
