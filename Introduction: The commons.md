# Introduction: The commons
Common goods are not owned by individuals and allow for the use by everyone. Examples for common goods are natural commons such as air to breathe, fish in the oceans or a public meadow shared by farmers to feed their animals. With the increasing insights of the life sciences into the fundamental setup of nature, the idea of natural goods can also be applied on organisms, cells, genes, pathways and any conceivable resources found in any organisms. The concept can be further enlarged with the advent of genetic engineering and its successor: synthetic biology. Now, discoveries, inventions and man-made creations such as genetic codes, algorithms, novel metabolic pathways and molecular processes designed for and realized in biological media and even entire organisms can be considered as natural goods. When looking for historic comparison of an extension of the commons to inventions and man-made creations, the most similar and recent problem was faced by the software developers during the 80s and 90s of the twentieth century. The debate in the computer science on the subject of what nature digital algorithms are – physical or abstract, a creation, invention or mathematical discoveries  - and how to make best use of them resulted in the formulation of a variety of digital licenses. Among those are the widely used examples like the creative common licenses, the GPL and GNU license frameworks. Today, these licenses allow the creative and inventive potential of the programmer to be directly placed into the commons as a resource meant to be shared by all.  The availability of decentralized creative commons in the internet enabled a community of private and corporate software developers and users to construct complex and open systems such as Wikipedia and the Linux. These systems allow a great number of people and private enterprises to make use of sophisticated tools and knowledge at little to no cost – depending on the license model. Such fundamental mechanisms help to avoid a classical market failure, a scenario in which all resources are commoditized, and no party has any incentive to contribute to a development which competitors may profit from at no cost. Despite the substantial success of commons in the digital world, there exists no similar licensing model for the life sciences. Citizens expressed the need to conceptualize the idea of a new intellectual property (IP) -regime for life-sciences to allow for a more productive use and generation of knowledge and innovation, further called “Bio-Commons”.
