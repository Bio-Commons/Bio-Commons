At the Pixelache Unconference in Helsinki, June 2014, a discussion was initiated during the Bio-Commons workshop setting out to identify the requirements and conditions of Open-Source and Citizen-Science concepts to realize Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the Life Sciences. In this whitepaper the results of the scenario thinking workshop and brainstorm discussions on the topic of the Bio-Commons are presented. As a way to realize these concepts, a hypothetical licensing model termed Bio-Commons (in analogy to the Creative-Commons) was discussed.  The ideas were worked out by participants with a professional background ranging from life sciences, engineering and arts to philosophy and law. Some of them associate themselves with the European DIYbio scene. Although the participants were mostly professionals in one or the other subject, no single person was an expert on all aspects of the Bio-Commons topic due to its transdisciplinary character. Therefore, participants are further simply referred to as ‘citizens’.  Citizens taking part in the discussion came from a broad range of countries from across Europe and south-east Asia. The report does not reflect any personal opinion unless otherwise stated, but serves as a summary of various ideas and concepts that were discussed.
