Due to the inherent ability of living systems (be it genetic elements or organisms) to autonomously proliferate, these can have effects which are out of the control of the user, posing problems for the liability of individuals. Despite these problems, it could eventually be a goal of society to make use of the functionality of a given living system in a non-contained manner. Citizens thought that democratic decision making is the best way to figure out whether or not this is the case. Opening up the Bio-Commons discussion and introducing democratic mechanisms will thus make everybody a stakeholder. By making use of decentralized crowd-review processes, as well as a democratization of scientific procedures, in-depth control of the applications of data in the Bio-Commons could be achieved. At this point, the idea of democratic self governance within the science remains speculative. A couple of questions arise with it â€“ for example how to guarantee a fair functionality of the science governance.
