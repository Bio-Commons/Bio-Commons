Concerning the life sciences, the general weakness of the prevailing IP system is further complicated by ethical problems arising through the advancing technical interventions in the foundations of biological existence â€“ especially that of human life. To date it is not entirely clear, how far the interventions will go and where the limit of technological control over living systems lies. However, it should be assumed that with increasing knowledge and technical skill, the sphere in which intentional interventions are possible will be expanded further. An exponential development of key technologies such as DNA-sequencing, DNA-synthesis and also automation, miniaturization and decentralization of laboratory practices underlines this prospective assumption. Anyways, it is common practice to patent inventions made in the life sciences. With the proposed Bio-Commons license model, biological innovation should be put into service to society and at the same time limit the potential for misuse of knowledge and material. Before creating a legal framework for the Bio-Commons, the social relations and assumptions underlying an idea of the Bio-Commons need to be addressed. Citizens considered the Bio-Commons as relationship and agreement between people, as eventually, the concept of property comes into conflict with ethical values. Thus, there will have to be a decision on where to draw the divisive line between a fact- and value based reference system for the Bio-Commons. It will have to be determined to what extent biological innovation can be seen as a cultural good and in how far it is a product subject to market mechanisms. Fundamental ideas as right of self-determination, the definition of individuality, the human rights (Compare the universal declaration of human rights articles 1- 5  ) and the ontology of life itself need to be renegotiated or reinterpreted when formulating the ethical principles for the Bio-Commons.
